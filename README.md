## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and go into the directory:

```
https://github.com/soph-lin/visa-app

cd visa-app
```

2. Install pnpm if you don't already have it:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Optional: set up a shorter alias like pn instead

For POSIX systems, add the following to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or config.fish:

alias pn=pnpm

For Powershell (Windows), go to a Powershell window with admin rights and run:

In the profile.ps1 file that opens, put:

set-alias -name pn -value pnpm

3. Install packages:

```
pnpm i
```

4. Run the development server (hosted on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)):

```
pnpm dev
```
